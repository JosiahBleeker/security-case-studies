# Endpoint Threat Investigation – User-Reported Malware Event

## Overview
This case study covers the investigation and remediation of a user-reported malware incident on a production workstation.

The goal was to determine whether the activity represented an active threat, contain any risk, and restore the endpoint to a secure operational state.

## Risk Context
Reported symptoms suggested possible compromise, creating risks such as:
- Potential malware persistence
- User exposure to social engineering
- Business disruption from compromised endpoints

---

## Investigation Actions

- Ensured no residual artifacts remained
- Educated the user on phishing and scam indicators

---

## Outcome
- Endpoint returned to a clean operational state
- No further malicious activity observed
- Reduced likelihood of repeat user-driven incidents

---

## Security Skills Demonstrated
- Endpoint alert triage
- Threat classification and validation
- Incident response fundamentals
